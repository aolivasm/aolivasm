# Antonio Olivas-Martinez - Personal Academic Website

Welcome to my personal academic website, built using the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) Jekyll theme.

## About Me

I am a **doctoral candidate** in **Biostatistics** at the **University of Washington**, with a background in **Mathematics** (University of Sonora) and **Internal Medicine** (INCMNSZ/UNAM). My research, supervised by **Dr. Andrea Rotnitzky**, focuses on developing statistical methods for estimating causal effects of continuous exposures in the presence of unmeasured confounding. One of the main applications of this work is identifying **correlates of protection in vaccine trials**, which aims to uncover immune markers that reliably predict vaccine efficacy and improve vaccine trial design.

Beyond my doctoral research, I have contributed to various projects, including:

- **Non-Inferiority Trials**: Developing a framework for active-controlled trials with **Dr. Holly Janes**.
- **Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy**: Conducting individual patient data meta-analyses to assess benefits for heart failure patients with **Dr. Lurdes Inoue**.
- **Cancer Screening**: Investigating bias in test sensitivity estimates with **Dr. Ruth Etzioni**.

I also collaborate with the **INCMNSZ** on research related to **COVID-19**, **HIV/AIDS**, **antimicrobial resistance**, **cancer**, and **gastrointestinal diseases**. Additionally, I am a member of **Mexicans in Statistics and Health**, a group dedicated to making complex scientific topics accessible to a broader audience.

My research interests include **causal inference**, **machine learning**, **clinical trials**, and **screening tests**, with a focus on advancing statistical methods to improve health outcomes.
